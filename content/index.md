## Bem vindo ao Yellow Quartz

This is a digital garden created and mainted by PÃ¢mela de Assis Beltrani, on this corner on internet I post everything that I'm creating and studying. I do create and study game development both as a programmer and a level designer, you can check my [[Projects Index]] note to have a look on it.

I choose to create a digital garden using  [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) with [Quartz 4.0](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) since is easy to maintain and I can have control over both the content and the structure presented. You can use both the Graph view and the folder structure on the lateral to navigate the digital garden. Enjoy your exploration.
