## Welcome to Blue Agate

This is a digital garden created and maintained by PÃ¢mela de Assis Beltrani, on this corner on internet I post everything that I'm creating and studying. I do create and study game development both as a programmer and a level designer, you can check my [[Game Development Projects List]] note to have a look on it.

I read a little about why I should be studying in public and since I love to learn everyday I'm bringing my notes under the folder Blue Agate, which was the original source Vault of it.

# How to navigate?
You can easily navigate by clicking on the internal links within each page, by using the interactive graph or the search bar.
# How did I make this?
I choose to create a digital garden using  [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) with [Quartz 4.0](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) since is easy to maintain and I can have control over both the content and the structure presented. You can use both the Graph view and the folder structure on the lateral to navigate the digital garden. Since I use a couple of plugins on Obsidian that will not translate well for Quartz, not all notes will be perfect to read directly from the browser. You can always always download my Vault on [Github](https://github.com/PamNawi/YellowQuartz) which should have everything ready to use on Obsidian.

Enjoy your exploration.
