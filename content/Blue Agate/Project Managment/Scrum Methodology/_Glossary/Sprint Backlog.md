The Sprint backlog is composed of the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Sprint Goal</mark> (why), the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">set of Product backlog items selected</mark> for the Sprint (what), as well an <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">actionable plan</mark> for delivering the Increment (how).

The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers. It is a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">higly visible, real-time picture</mark> of the work that the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve. Consequently, the Sprint backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned. It should have enough detail that they can inspect their progresses in the Daily Scrum.
