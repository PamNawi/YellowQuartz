The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary

The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves self-management.

Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings.

The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprintâ€™s work.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">- Do I see any impediment</mark> that prevents me or us from meeting the Sprint Goal?

Scrum Master ensures that the team have the meeting, _but_ the Developers are responsible if the scrum master is away
