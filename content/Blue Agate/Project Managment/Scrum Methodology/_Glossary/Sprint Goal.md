Tags: #Scrum #Artifact #SprintGoal

The Sprint goal is the single objective for the Sprint. Although the Sprint Goal is commitment by the developers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it."_

The sprint goal is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Sprint Backlog. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">As the developers work during the Sprint, they keep the Sprint Goal in mind.
</mark> If the work turns out to be different than they expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal.
