The Sprint is a container for all others events. Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts. These events are specifically designed to enable the transparency required.
<h4>The Sprint:</h4>
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Time boxed: Maximum 1 calendar month</mark>

Are the heartbeat of Scrum. They have a fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency. A new sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous sprint

All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including the Sprint planning, Daily, Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective happen within Sprints.

- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint goal
- Quality does not decrease
- The Product Backlog is refined as needed
- Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.

Sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Product Goal at least every calendar month. When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the Sprint Goal may become invalid, complexity may rise, and risk may increase. Shorter Sprints can be employed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame. Each Sprint may be considered a short project.

*A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint.*

<h4>Sprint Planning: (Aka Sprint Planning in Strawberry fields) </h4>
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Time boxed: 8hrs/month</mark>

Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team. 

The Product Owner ensures that attendees are prepared to discuss the most important Product Backlog items and how they map to the Product Goal. The Scrum Team may also invite other people to attend Sprint Planning to provide advice.

1. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Why</mark> is this Sprint valuable?
The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. 

The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. 

The _Sprint Goal_ must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning.

2. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">What</mark> can be Done this Sprint?
Through discussion with the Product Owner, the Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint. The Scrum Team may refine these items during this process, which increases understanding and confidence.

Selecting how much can be completed within a Sprint may be challenging. However, the more the Developers know about their past performance, their upcoming capacity, and their Definition of Done, the more confident they will be in their Sprint forecasts.

3. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">How</mark> will the chosen work get done?
For each selected Product Backlog item, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done. This is often done by decomposing Product Backlog items into smaller work items of one day or less. How this is done is at the sole discretion of the Developers. No one else tells them how to turn Product Backlog items into Increments of value.
<h4>Daily Scrum (AKA Gone in 60s)</h4>
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Time boxed : 15min/day and always at the same place</mark>

The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary

The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves self-management.

Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings.

The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprint’s work.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">- What did I do yesterday</mark> that helped us meet the sprint goal?
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">- What will I do today</mark> to help us meet the Sprint Goal?
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">- Do I see any impediment</mark> that prevents me or us from meeting the Sprint Goal?

Scrum Master ensures that the team have the meeting, _but_ the Developers are responsible if the scrum master is away

<h4>Sprint Review (AKA Demo)</h4>
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Time boxed: 4 hours for 1 month sprint maximum</mark>

The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.

The Sprint Review is the second to last event of the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.
<h4>Sprint Retrospective (Retro)</h4>
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Time boxed: 3 hours for 1 month sprint maximum</mark>

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.

The Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness. The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible. They may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint.

The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.
