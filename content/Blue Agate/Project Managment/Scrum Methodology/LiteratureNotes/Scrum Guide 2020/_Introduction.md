The purpose of the Scrum Guide is to contain the definition of Scrum. 
Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value though adaptive solutions for complex problems.

The Scrum master need to foster an environment where:
	1. The Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product backlog.
	2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of work into an Increment of value during a Sprint
	3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint
	4. Repeat.

The scrum framework is _purposefully incomplete_, only defining the parts required to implement Scrum theory.
