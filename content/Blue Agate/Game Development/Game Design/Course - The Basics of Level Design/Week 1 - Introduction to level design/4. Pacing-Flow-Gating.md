# Pacing
Pacing refers to the "rhythm" of certain section of the game. Knowing where to place important "moments" or "beats", and where and how often to place decision points for a player, is key to design good levels.
A "moment" is a unique situation that will evoke an emotional response or require the player to make a meaningful choice. While a "beat" is generally a smaller moment, usually a split-second decision made by the players. Different genres will have different pacing requirements and different kinds of interactivities.

# Flow
Flow is the process of the player move through the level. There's different ways to affect flow and depending on the genre of the game, you will want to encourage or discourage certain kinds of low.

# Gating
Gating is process of forcing the player forward by preventing them from going backwards. Gating is often used in linear games, however in today's games is avoided as much as possible.
