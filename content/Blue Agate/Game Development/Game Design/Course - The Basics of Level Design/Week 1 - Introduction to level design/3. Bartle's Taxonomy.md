### The Achiever
They are all about points and status. They want to show their friends how they are progressing. They love to collect badges and put it on display. Bartle estimates that roughly 10% of people are this kind of player.

### The Explorer
The explores want to see new things and discover new secrets. Explorers are fine with repetitive tasks as long they eventually 
"unlock" a new area of the game or they deliver some kind of "Easter Egg". Around 10% of the players fit into this category.

### The Socializer
Around 80% of the players are Socializers. They experience fun in the game through their interaction with other players.

### The Killer
The Killers are similar to Achievers in the way that they get a thrill from gaining points and winning status too. What sets them apart is that Killers want to see other people lose. They are competitive, and winning is what motivates them. You expect this type of personality to be common, but Bartle's research suggest that only a small number of players are Killers, less than 1% to be precise.
