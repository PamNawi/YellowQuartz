# Rule of Thirds
This concept is borrowed from psychology and photography whereby we mentally segment the screen or image into thirds. *Important things are generally placed at the dividing lines, either horizontally or vertically.*

# Leading Lines
You can use existing lines in the environment to lead the player's gaze. You can use them to show the player things you want to mark as important.

# Landmarks
Landmarks can be also called points of interest or focal points are large, recognizable sets pieces in the game environment. Landmarks should be big enough that can be seen from many places within a level. They are very useful in large, open-world games where the player has a lot of freedom of movement within the environment.

# Depth of Field
Depth of field is another concept from photography and film and refers from how far away from the player things appear. There are three broad categories of distance: foreground, midground and background. This concept is also useful when considering firing ranges in first-person-shooters

# Waypoints

Waypoints are used to guide the player though a level and can be used subtle or direct. Some of the tools can be used to help navigate through a level including landmarks, specific colors or lighting enemies, movement in the environment or visual effects.
