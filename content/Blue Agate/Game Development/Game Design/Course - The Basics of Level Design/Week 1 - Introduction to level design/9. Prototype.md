# Paper Prototype
Planning is often done through a paper prototype. It can be a 2D map of the level created on paper or even a simple computer program.

Sometimes its possible to create a flow diagram or even a bubble diagram to get the general idea on how the spaces connect to each other. This stage allows to plan around the flow and the pacing impose. After you have a flow diagram its possible to create a simple 2D paper map to start thinking about how precisely the map will be laid out in the game world. A grid can help during this phase and is essential in some game genres.

# Grey Block Stage

The goal is to create a physical structure of the level in form of crude 3D models. These models will lack textures, skins or lighting effects and will appear as simple grey blocks. The grey block should give a good idea of the flow since gameplay mechanics should be playable in the level by the end of this phase

# Meshing Stage
In the meshing stage, all the gameplay elements are present and all core flow elements have been dealt with. The crude geometric shapes of the grey block are replaced with near-final 3D assets. Sometimes a landmark or point-of-interest mesh is needed to address the orientation issues that should be resolved at this stage. Some texture is also added during this stage.


# Lighting and Polish Stage
This is the final polish pass where any outlying flow issues are addressed and the level is finalized. The lights are added with the light effects. Lighting can be a powerful tool for leading players and can be also used to highlight landmarks. Implementing the final textures on objects and surfaces in level also happens during this stage.

# Iteration and Feedback
Level design is a iterative process! In each stage there's a constant back and forth between the various elements of the design and the QA teams. Is expected to revise and rework numerous times at each stage of development. Depending on the game studio, a level designer may only be involved at one of these phases, or may be involved at all stages. Generally, multiple level designers will give feedback at each stage.
