A story-based level is one that advances the narrative of the game, it focus on the narrative, world building, exploration, encounters and NPCs.
# Encounters
These are moments that involve other characters, they can include non-combat and combat encounters with NPCs.

# Dungeons
Dungeons are a separate gameplay space, usually created for an encounter of specific type with a concrete objective.

_"In level design, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">a dungeon is a space separated from the overworld and built for a specific encounter</mark>. These can either help push the narrative forward, or be a space to take the player momentarily away from the story to focus just on combat and/or puzzle solving."_

Its possible that dungeons may be a side-quest designed only to help the player gain some resource or learn a specific game mechanic.

The shrines on Zelda: Breath of the Wild are primarily focused on puzzles mechanics and they have the goal to teach these mechanics. As the player progress through a shrine, they will encounter a puzzle mechanic, deployed or reemployed in a increasingly complex fashion, without any story elements but with a clear objective to get to the end.
