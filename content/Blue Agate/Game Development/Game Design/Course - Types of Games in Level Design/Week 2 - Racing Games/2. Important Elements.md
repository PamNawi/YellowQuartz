### Competition:
Players should be given opportunities to do things better than their opponents. Even in games where head-to-head competition is not possible, this element of competition can be introduced with track timers and high score lists.

### Speed: 
Players should also be given opportunities to experience the thrill of high speed: zipping over speed boosters before launching over a ramp, or blasting past their opponent thanks to a high-speed item or souped-up car. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Some games place basic AI-driven cars driving at low speed on the track to give you the impression that you’re driving very quickly</mark>, and to add the challenge of obstacles to avoid. Effects like motion blur and the inclusion of a speedometer in the player’s heads-up display (HUD) can also serve to enhance the element of speed.

### Optimal Paths:
Its necessary to consider what are the optimal route a player can made since racing games can have multiple and even shortcuts. A level designer should also keep in mind the turns where the player might adjust their speed.
