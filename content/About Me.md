Hello! I'm Pâmela de Assis Beltrani, a passionate programmer and game development enthusiast based in São Francisco do Sul, Santa Catarina. With a strong academic background, including a master's degree in Informatics from UFPR and specialization in Digital Game Development from PUC-PR, I've honed my skills in languages such as Python, C++, and C#, along with proficiency in Unity.

My journey in programming has been enriched by diverse projects, from predicting movement in distributed games to crafting maps for Android applications. As a former professor at Universidade Positivo, I've had the pleasure of teaching subjects like Computer Graphics and Artificial Intelligence, sharing my knowledge with eager minds.

Recently, I've delved into the exciting realm of game design as a Level Designer at Strawberry Fields Inc, contributing to immersive 3D environments for games like Aexia. My work is not just about coding; it's about crafting experiences that captivate and inspire.
