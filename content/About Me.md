Hello! I'm Pâmela de Assis Beltrani, a passionate programmer and game development enthusiast based in São Francisco do Sul, Santa Catarina. With a strong academic background, including a master's degree in Informatics from UFPR and specialization in Digital Game Development from PUC-PR, I've honed my skills in languages such as Python, C++, and C#, along with proficiency in Unity.

My journey in programming has been enriched by diverse projects, from predicting movement in distributed games to crafting maps for Android applications. As a former professor at Universidade Positivo, I've had the pleasure of teaching subjects like Computer Graphics and [[_Classroom notes for Game Development on AI | Artificial Intelligence]], sharing my knowledge with eager minds. The content generated during this period is in Portuguese and I will probably not translate it into English (sorry, to lazy for that). You can have more details at my [[Resumé]]

Recently, I've delved into the exciting realm of game design as a Level Designer at Strawberry Fields Inc, contributing to immersive 3D environments for games like [[_Aexia|Aexia]]. My work is not just about coding; it's about crafting experiences that captivate and inspire.
