This is an article that I read by Bill Merrill for GameAIPro.

"In a standard behavior tree, priority is static. Its baked right into the tree."

This is what create the easy to understand and perfect for game to use, since is very "well behaved" and easy to teach for the game designers to use

"Industry veterans who advocate the use of utility theory like to remind us that there is rarely just one correct decision to make. So the question is : why do we still favor decision-making architectures that fail to address this problem elegantly?"

"The most important goal is to ensure that the overall computation is reliable given any combination of inputs, and always results in *reasonable choice*".

This phrases reminds me from my [[1. Introdução à IA]] class notes that always say that "rationality is not the same as perfection". The decision don't need to be the perfect one, but one that make sense for the context. The author even complements this thinking by saying:

"Game agents are approximations of autonomous entities within the limited scope of game's specific design. ... All that should concern us is building an experience that feels believable and engaging to the player within the context of the game."

He also highlight the importance of keeping the variables simple so it easy to understand how the curve will behave.
