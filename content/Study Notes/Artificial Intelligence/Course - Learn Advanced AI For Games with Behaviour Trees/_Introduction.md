# Status: In Progress

This is a course that I'm starting to take on May 2024. It should expand my knowledge on this subject and during this course I should be constructing a Behavior Tree Library from the scratch. 

# Section 1 - Behavior Tree Concepts
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **✔️**
This sections explains and builds the foundation of Behaviour Trees and the API. The concepts presented are very well presented and easy to understand

[[1. Behavior Tree Basic Concepts]]

# Section 2 - Advanced Behaviours
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
This section expands the concepts presented on the first one and also presents a couple of challenges to be programmed. Its very useful like the first one.

[[2. Advanced Behaviours]]
