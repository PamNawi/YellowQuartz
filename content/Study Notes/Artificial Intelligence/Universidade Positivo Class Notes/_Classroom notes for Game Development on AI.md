For 2016 until 2020 I teach for the game development course on Positivo University in Curitiba. During this years I created some study notes that I used on my classrooms.  I'm importing it as they where delivered to my students and I don't plan to translate it. 

At the beginning of the course they received a list [[Links Recomendados|Recommended Links for AI]] to expand their knowledge and learn more about the subject of the class

- [[1. Introdução à IA]]
- [[2. Tipos de Ambientes e Agentes Inteligentes]]
- [[3. Estrutura Interna de um Agente]]
- [[4. Steering Behaviors]]
- [[5. Tomada de Decisões]]
- [[6. Métodos de Busca Cega]]
- [[7. Métodos de Busca com Heurística]]
