# What is appealing and what is boring?
- Humans are a pattern addicts
- Creating new dependency for patterns in a unexpected why create interest for humans, but we need to keep in a way that human brains can still found some pattern to be looking for
- Increasing the number of an object occurrence, we decrease the overall interest in this.

# "Rules assembly as language"
**Question**: Is creativity about revealing previously unfamiliar connections?
