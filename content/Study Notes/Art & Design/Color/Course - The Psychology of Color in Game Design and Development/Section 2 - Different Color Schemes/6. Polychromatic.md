# What it is
- It refers to a scheme that has several colors in it (like 6, 7 or even 8 colors)
- The term often refer to the styles of architecture (old Egypt), pottery and sculptures (ancient Greek)... usually surfaces that where used to tell an story so they **need** more colors

# How its used
- It main purpose is to describe a light to showcase more than on hue of color
- This means that it has more than one wavelength

_"From a game perspective, if you want a polychromatic scheme in your level you have to understand that not all hues works well together so you can't show too many hues that pull away the user's attention ... can't all be bright red, bright blue, bright yellow because the player will be confused half of the time by being pulled to the different elements on the scene."_
