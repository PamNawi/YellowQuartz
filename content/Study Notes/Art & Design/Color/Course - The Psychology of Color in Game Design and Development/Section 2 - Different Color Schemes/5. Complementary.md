# What it is
- A pair of colors that are opposite to each other on the color wheel
- They also cancel each other's hue by creating a white, black or grey mixture
- When they are paired together they create a sharp contrast and stick out
- Depending on which color theory is being used, the colors can have different complementary ones
- Modern Color Theory is either:
	- RGB Additive Color
	- CMY Subtractive Color
	- The complementary colors are:
		- Red - Cyan
		- Green - Magenta
		- Blue - Yellow
-  The opponent process theory says that the most contrasting of all color pairs are:
	- Red - Green
	- Blue - Yellow

# How its used
- Using this color scheme creates a very aesthetically pleasing visual for the user
- This allows for the image that is being displayed to look brighter
- To produce some great results, try placing cool colors against warm colors
- Choose a dominant color and use it complementary as an accent
	- Ex: use one for a background and the other to highlight key elements

The following scene is built using 2 lighter complementary colors to show the sky and the ground and also use another pair of darker complementary colors to highlight the most important objects on the scene: the mountain and the 2 characters.
