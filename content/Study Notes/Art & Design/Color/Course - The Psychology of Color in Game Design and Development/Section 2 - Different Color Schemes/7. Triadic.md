# What it is
- The use of 3 colors equally spaced out on the color wheel
- They form a perfect triangle between each color

# How its used
- This scheme is great for creating very vibrant scenes
- Creates a strong contrast, while at the same time keeping a very balanced harmony
- Not as contrasting as complementary scheme though

- To successfully use this scheme, the colors must be carefully balanced
- Having one color dominate and use the other 2 as accents to create harmony
- A good rule of thumb is to choose one primary color as your dominant and then choosing either maybe a lighter versions of the secondary.
