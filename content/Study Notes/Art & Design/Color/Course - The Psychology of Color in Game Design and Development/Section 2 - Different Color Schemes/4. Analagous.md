# What it is
- Groups of 3 colors that are next to each other on the color wheel
- One color being the dominant (Primary/Secondary) and the other 2 on each side complimenting it
- This type of scheme creates a rich monochromatic look
- This way works well with a lot of warm or cool colors, but never mixing the two and always keeping them separated. Creating a temperature

# How its used
- It's a richer look than a monochromatic
- This scheme lacks color contrast in comparison to complementary

The next one has the whole environment using an analogous color scheme
