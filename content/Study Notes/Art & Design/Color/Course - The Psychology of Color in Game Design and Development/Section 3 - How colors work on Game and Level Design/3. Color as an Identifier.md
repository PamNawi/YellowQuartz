# Definition 
The grouping or separation of game elements to clearly define important mechanics

# How it's used in Design
- The use of identifiers in games is no new practice
- Sometimes a red shirt can mean multiple things in a game:
	- Bleeding
	- Santa Clause
	- Chinese New Year

- And other times, it's just a red shirt
- The use of theses color indicators is only to recognize an object just by its color
- The tokens in sorry have no special abilities between the colors, they mark which is each player
- They serve as the bond between objects and mechanics
