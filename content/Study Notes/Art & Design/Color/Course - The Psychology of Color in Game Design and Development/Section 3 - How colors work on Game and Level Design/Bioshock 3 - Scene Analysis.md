- What emotional theme is taking place here?
This seems a space where a player can take a pause, welcoming with the yellow and oranges. The purple being used on the woman on the center highlights her presence as  being "above" the others, the glass. Its sacred and the player is being welcomed to take a deep breath before the action. Her head is even highlighted as sacred with light yellow forming a halo around it.

_"I feel that it is the beginning of something new. The use of Yellow represent something of new life, awakening"_

- What color scheme do you think is being used here?

Seems that is being used the complementary color scheme with the Yellows being the main color and the Purples being used to contrast it. Even the grass has a mudded orange color on this scene.

_"I would say that in this scene, they are using an Analogous color scheme. They play on a very fall season color palette."_

- How would you describe your reaction if you played this game?
Their eyes probably will first focus on the glass portrait on the background with the bright yellows contrasted by the purples being framed by the greens.

After that, the lines made by the floor in front of the player character, which is highlighted by being the most close to black one on the scene, the background elements pulls the attention to the man who even has a circle indicating that he is "the final objective" on this scene. The path guiding to this man also is on a warmer color, closer to red, creating a certain anxiety/excitement for the player to guide her character

_"If i was the girl walking into the room, the first thing i would notice is the man standing in the center of the room. There is a faint yellow beam of light radiating from where he is standing, inclination he is a person of interest. The lines in the room also point to the man in the middle as well"_

! I didn't saw the ray of light above the mans head as a leading line, but makes a lot of sense!
