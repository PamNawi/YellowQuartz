# Definition

- Using color to label an object amongst other objects
- All other colors are referred to as neutral in a color layout
- To label colors to an object, we must assume that the user's knowledge is the bare minimum
- Use a base label the works for the general population
- "Keep it simple!"

# Labeling
- Use of visual elements that can be verbally named
- Use of *only* Primary and Secondary Colors as color glyphs
- Some colors that can also be included:
	- Black
	- White

# Exclusivity
- When it comes to exclusivity, sometimes a color that would be seen as an identifier isn't due to the nature of not separating it from other elements
- This can take place in any number of settings, where less dominant colors must act as identifiers

On Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles green is not considered a glyph since all turtle have it and their masks and accessories with blue, yellow, purple and orange are their.
