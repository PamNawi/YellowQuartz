# Definition
- The distribution of contrasting colors in a scene or image
- Can also be for an individual game asset like models, sprites or GUI elements
- A layout can be either:
	- Spatially : 2 colors next to each other
	- Sequential : Contrasting colors occupy the same area and alternate between each other
- A layout can also have both at the same time
- The [color weight](https://www.robertnajlis.com/color-theory/color-weights/) distribution plays a key role in designing a color layout
- The weight helps identify which color is supporting the context for the other one
- Allocating more space or time to a specific color is how effectively use weight distribution
# Canvas & Objects
- Color Canvas: The context of which color objects stand out. Have meaning through contrasts
- A canvas must never draw the players attention as a focus point
- Its main purpose is to support the identifier that the designer wants to showcase

- The background is a light gray that is not drawing out attention to it, meaning there's no contrasting views that are pulling our eyesight. The player being black forces us to look at it.

- Color Object : Colored elements that draw the players attention
- The main task for color objects is to give the player instant recognition of what is is and does
- Objects on a object layer can be in contrast with each other, but must stand out from the canvas
- When looking at sequential color objects, there must be a very visible distinction of the change of colors
- Some examples of effective sequential:
	- Crosshair for FPS games which is green/white and when is locked to a player it changes to red indicating that he is in a kill shot spot
	- An enemy takes damage that blink red when taking damage
	- Led of a bomb

# Glyphs and Neutrals with Color Layouts
- To deliver an effective visual message to the player, a fusion of glyphs, neutrals and color layouts must take place
- A well established color canvas will became a neutral, while a glyph will be used to make a color object stand out.

_"So that's how they they work together and the glyphs that you associate with your color identifiers are gonna become your color objects and you want to make sure that you support those color objects were an appropriate canvas in order to do that."_
