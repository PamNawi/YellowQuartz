# Conclusion
- Consider how materials, moods, symbols, tones and the emotional impact that goes into the coloring of your character, environment and props
- Never forget how to use glyphs and neutrals to improve gameplay

_"You have to really choose what colors you want to use as an identifier and then see how the others colors could help to build out different types of elements"_

- Using these patterns well can be super effective to visually guide the player
- When it comes to using glyphs, don't forget to keep it simple
- Always design for the most player base possible
