# Emotion
- When creating a scene to show the player, think of what emotion you want to create for them
- Color can set the tone and mood of any scene, regardless of what is being shown

On this scene from World of Warcraft concept art is used a color scheme made with blues, reds and yellow/oranges. The scene use a lot of blues which signifiers calmness, but the red on the top of the celling's quickly grabs the eye and conduct the view of the viewer to the staircase on the end of the room. On the floor and on the celling there's also a yellow line conducting the view of the viewer.

- **Top Left:** Uses yellow and the brightness of it so with this shot if the player entered into the town feeling as a new adventure waiting for him
- **Top Right:** This will be probably the middle of the day, with colors not so contrasting as the left one
- **Bottom Left:** Seems very abandoned looking with the green and the very contrasting yellow and red. Indicating a possible beginning of a new day, with anticipation from something lurking behind a corner
- **Bottom Right:** Its a very monochromatic level where different shades of red are used on the entire area making the whole scene daunting and foreshadowing event like a boss fight or very dark scene.

- Maps are excellent progress references as they can showcase where the player traveled and unexplored pathways. Also give the players a goal to explore it

# Visual Hierarchy
- Its is important to build your game scene in such way that it showcases the important elements you want the player to focus on
- When placing elements in a scene, a hierarchy will naturally form
- An example can be: Player > Enemies/NPCs > Interactable Objects > Background
- Color helps these focus points become more visually exclusive
- Using glyphs and neutrals is important to create identifiers
- But taking that a step further, the use of value, saturation and hues can further distinguish important elements
- This can help where color is not represent in a game
