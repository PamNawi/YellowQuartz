# Create more Depth
- To not make the levels feel dull and plain, adding color variations can keep the user engaged
- Having different hues for the same scene can change the player's emotion on a whim
- This can either be done manually or procedurally
- Manually chaning color schemes for a level gives more control to the designer
- Procedural color scheme generating will make the game always feel fresh

# Color Swapping
- Sometimes a game is limited to the amount of space it has
- This was a common issue not to long ago
- Having icons associated with the identifier helps create more depth

- When a color is designated to being of a specific value, then using that hue to color code certain items is useful
- Regardless if the same image is being used, the player will look past that and see the hue of the image and associate it to its value
