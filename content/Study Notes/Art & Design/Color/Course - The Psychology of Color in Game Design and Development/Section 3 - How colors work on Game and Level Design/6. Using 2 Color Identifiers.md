# Their use in Games
- Many games use this classic set up
- Its great for 2 factions that are against each other
- In 2 player games, the use of 2 mutually exclusive glyphs help identify the teams
- Using glyphs represent the territory

- Sometimes 2 identifiers can drive a symbolic/emotional meaning
- Good versus Evil
- Different powers
- The best way to represent this is by choosing 2 colors as opposite as possible from each other. 
- Using a complementary color scheme would be the most ideal way to use that color scheme effectively and obviously there's different types

# The message they deliver
- The best practice is by using warm vs cool colors
- Red and Blue are the most used for this contrast
- Red and Green or Blue and Orange also work well
- A warm primary versus  cold secondary works well too

! Take care to not be using red and blue all over the place

_"Make sure that you have your identifiers strictly laid out for your glyphs and then start creating your neutrals to support those two identifiers"_
