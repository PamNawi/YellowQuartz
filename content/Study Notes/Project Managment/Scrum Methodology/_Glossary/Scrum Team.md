<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">The Scrum Team consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers</mark>. Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies.

The Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people. In general, we have found that smaller teams communicate better and are more productive.

The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint. Scrum defines three specific accountabilities within the Scrum Team: the [[Developers]], the [[Product Owner]], and the [[Scrum Master]].
