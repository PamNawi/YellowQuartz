An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together.</mark> In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable.

Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint. The sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review thus supporting empiricism. However, an Increment may be delivered to stake holders prior to the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Revie should never be considered a gate to releasing value. Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done.
