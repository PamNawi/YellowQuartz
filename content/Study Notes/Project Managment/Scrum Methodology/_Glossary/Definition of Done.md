Tags: #Scrum #DefinitionOfDone

_"The definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product."_

The moment a Product Backlog item meets the definition of Done, an Increment is born. The definition of Done creates a transparency. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done, should not be released or even presented at the Sprint Review.</mark> Instead, returns in the Product Backlog for future consideration.

If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum.<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> If it is not an oranizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a definition of done appropriate for the product.</mark>
