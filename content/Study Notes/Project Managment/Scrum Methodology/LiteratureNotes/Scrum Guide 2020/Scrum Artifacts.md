Scrum's artifacts represent work or value. They are <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">designed to maximize transparency.</mark> Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured:

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">- Product Backlog -> Product Goal</mark>
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">- Sprint Backlog -> Sprint Goal</mark>
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">- Increment -> Definition of Done</mark>

Everyone must be transparent and honest about the project, product backlog, sprint backlog & final increment
<h2>Product Backlog</h2>
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Is a ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.</mark>

The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability and ordering.

Product backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event. Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items..

Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing. The Product Owner may influence the Developers by helping them understand and select trade-offs.

The Product Backlog Refinement is the act of adding detail, estimatives and order to items in the Product Backlog. The objective is to have list of items ordered by priority with very well clarified with smaller manageable chuncks tha can be done in a sprint.
<h5>Product Goal</h5>
_"A Product is a vehicle to deliver value. It has a clear boundary, known stakeholders, well-defined users or customers. A product could be a service, a physical product, or something more abstract."_

The <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Product goal is the long-term objective</mark> for the Scrum Team. They must fulfill (or abandon one objective) before taking on the next.
<h2>Sprint Backlog</h2>
The Sprint backlog is composed of the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Sprint Goal</mark> (why), the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">set of Product backlog items selected</mark> for the Sprint (what), as well an <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">actionable plan</mark> for delivering the Increment (how).

The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers. It is a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">higly visible, real-time picture</mark> of the work that the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve. Consequently, the Sprint backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned. It should have enough detail that they can inspect their progresses in the Daily Scrum.
<h4>Sprint Goal </h4>
_"The Sprint goal is the single objective for the Sprint. Although the Sprint Goal is commitment by the developers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it."_

The sprint goal is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Sprint Backlog. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">As the developers work during the Sprint, they keep the Sprint Goal in mind.
</mark> If the work turns out to be different than they expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal.
<h2>Releasable Product Increment</h2>
An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together.</mark> In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable.

Multiple Increments may be created whitin a Sprint. The sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review thus supporting empiricism. However, an Increment may be delivered to stake holders prior to the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Revie should never be considered a gate to releasing value. Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done.
<h4>Definition of Done</h4>
_"The definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product."_

The moment a Product Backlog item meets the definition of Done, an Increment is born. The definition of Done creates a transparency. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">If a Product Backlog item does note meet the Definition of Done, should not be released or even presented at the Sprint Review.</mark> Instead, returns in the Product Backlog for future consideration.

If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum.<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> If it is not an oranizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a definition of done appropriate for the product.</mark>
