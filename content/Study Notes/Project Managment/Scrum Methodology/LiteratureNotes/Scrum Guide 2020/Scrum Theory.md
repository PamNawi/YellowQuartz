Scrum combines four formal events for inspection adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint. These events work because they implement the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection and adaptation.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">1. Transparency:</mark>
	- The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work.
	- *Transparency enables inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful*

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">2. Inspection:</mark>
	- The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems.
	- Inspection enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">3. Adaptation:</mark>
	- If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted. The adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.
	- Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing.
