# Status: **‚úîÔ∏è Abandoned**

This is a course that I'm taking during April 2024 titled 
"Worldbuilding for Video Games". This course should take 1 month to be done. This course should be taken after the Video Game Writing Essentials, but I just ignored this warning üòÜ.

# Final Review:

It was really focused on writing, which is not my cup of tea, so I prefered at the time to focus on other courses like the [[Study Notes/Art & Design/Color/Course - The Psychology of Color in Game Design and Development/_Introduction|The Psychology of Color Theory in Game Design and Development]]
