# What is a Shooter

A shooter is a game that uses ranged combat as a primary mechanic and can be divided into a variety of subgenres.

# Basic Mechanics
## Cover
This refer to a degree of exposure to an enemy fire. Notice that this is related with how much the body of the player is exposed. Some games incorporate a "snap-to-cover", where a player can command their character to cover behind the object. While other consider that some weapons can partially or even fully penetrate a cover.

# Range
This is the distance which the weapon can maintain accuracy. Some weapons are more effective on short than at long range.
