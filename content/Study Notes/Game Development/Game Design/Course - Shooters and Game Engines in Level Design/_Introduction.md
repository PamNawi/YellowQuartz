# Status: Doing

This is a course that I'm taking during April 2024 titled 
"Shooters and Game Engines in Level Design". This course is focused on level design for shooters, since I don't play shooters on general I expect to learn a lot from it.

# Introduction to Shooters / Ranged Combat Mechanics

[[1. What is a Shooter]]
