Sightlines are literally how far, in what direction, and to what extent a player can see. Providing variation on sightlines is critical in creating varied combat encounters in some genres as FPS.

# Orientation
In order for the players to understand where they are, sometimes is necessary to provide them with means to reorient themselves in the environment, specially on open-world games. Its common to facilitate the orientation by using in-game landmarks that give the player a  vantage point which to survey the surrounding environment.

_"In the Assassinâ€™s Creed games, players can use free-running and parkour navigation to climb tall buildings. Certain tall buildings act as viewpoints in the game, which allow the player to survey their surroundings and, in some games, collect useful information for their mini-map."_

# Navigation
Navigation is how your players makes their way through the game environment. It can be as simples as walking or driving, or it can include movements like climbing, wall-running, jumping, flying, teleporting and so on. Creating multiple interesting routes for different styles of navigation especially on open-world games where the players are encouraged to explore.

# Signifiers
Signifiers are objects in the game environment that communicate certain messages to the player. Players once taught what the signifier communicates will remember that association for the rest of the game.
