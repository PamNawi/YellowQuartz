Affordances are when a player knows how to use something by just looking at it. There are certain objects in a game where the form implies function.

# Resources
Resources refer to things that can be collected by the player as they move through a level. Well considered placement of resources is crucial to a good level design, can help create important moment and contribute to creation of flow.

# Spawn Points
A spawn point is a location where the player's avatar enters the game world. Much like resource placement, choosing the correct place for a character to start the level is important in level design.
