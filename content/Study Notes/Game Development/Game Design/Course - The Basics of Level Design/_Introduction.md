This is a course that I'm taking during April 2024 titled "The Basics of Level Design". This course should take around 3 months to be done, but I made on 3 days. The notes taken for this course can be sawn on the following list:

# Final Review:
⭐⭐
The course was somewhat good for someone who never studied anything about level design, but for me who already have some training on the area there was little to learn. I got some terms formalized on the first section but the second and the third module where not much useful for me.
