Its common to have procedural generation algorithms to use a Set of sections or rooms, sometimes referenced as "chunks". The algorithm will pick from a database of predefined chunks when assembling the level procedurally.

# Rogue as a Case of Study
The course suggest that we play the game [Rogue](https://archive.org/details/ROGUE_PD) using a DOS Emulator and after it asks some questions:

-  What did you notice about the level design and progression? Was each playthrough memorably different?
- Did you ever get stuck at a dead end? 
- Did you notice any differences between the enemies? 
- What did you enjoy about the game? 
- What was frustrating?
- Can you see why this game had widespread appeal and how it spawned a genre of similar games?

# Considerations when designing a procedural level
When designing procedural levels, a level designer should still take into account the same elements they would take if they designed by hand:
- Frequency of enemies
- Frequency of rewards
- Size of rooms
- Numbers of rooms per section of the floor, area or dungeon
- Scaling difficulty

Is necessary to keep in mind that there's less control over the experience.
