# Planning Phase
A documentation to help the future phase
- Description of the place and the major plot
- Landmarks : POIs
- NPCs (who is here and doing what?)
- References images for the POIs and environment
- 2-D Map

- Districts:
	- Can create distinct areas within the level. Have factors that can differentiate these districts, such as architectural styles, environmental features or gameplay mechanics

# World Building
### Theme and Setting: 
Establish a cohesive theme and setting for the level:
- Visual elements
- Architecture
- Terrain
- Vegetation
- Props

These should align with the chosen theme to create a consistent and believable world

### Scale and Proportions
Varying sizes of objects, structures and landscapes can create a sense of depth or intimacy within the level

Consider the relationship between different elements in the environment to achieve a believable space

### Level of Detail
Finding the right balance of detail within your world building. Certain areas or focal points might require more attention to detail while other areas can be more simplified

Optimizing performance and ensuring a smooth gameplay experience by managing the level of detail appropriately

### Sound and Atmosphere
Sound design contributes to the overall atmosphere and immersion. Ambient sounds, music and sound effects can complement the visual elements and create a more immersive experience for the players.

# Districts
Divide the big area in smaller and distinct pieces
- Add the sense of variety
- Use visual language to differentiate then


# Landmarks, POIs, Focal Points
Landmark: Structures that help the player to navigate around the level

POI: Area of location to get the player attention

Focal points: Areas or elements that intentionally designed to grab the player attention. They help with the composition

You want to landmarks, POIs and focal points to be very distinctive


# Start Big, then go smaller
- Player Path
	- Are there places to go?
	- Does it make sense to move from one area to the next?
	- Are the larger shapes in sight when you hope?
- Basic Sightlines
	- Set up your composition
	- Create opportunities for awesome views and routes
	- Pay attention to your shapes if they block the view
- Negative and Positive Space
- Large and Small Structures
- Shape Placement 
- Possible POI

Once you have a rough layout, think about what blockout piece would help your level most. What would be repeated?
