# Missions

- The mission should have a clear overall objective that the player needs to accomplish
	- Example: Reach a specific location in a survival horror game, the player might have to navigate through a haunted mansion to reach a safe room where important story-related documents are located
	- Example: Rescue a character in a platformer game, the player may be required to recue a kidnapped character by navigating through a series of challenging levels, overcoming obstacles and enemies along the way.
	- Example: Defeat a boss in a action-adventure game, the player may need to defend a powerful enemy boss who is blocking access to the next area or holding a crucial piece of info

- The mission should be grounded in the game's narrative providing relevant story elements or advancing the plot. It should connect to the larger story arc and contribute to the player's understanding of the game world, characters or events
	- Example: Gathering intel in a spy-themed game, the player might undertake a mission to infiltrate an enemy base and gather crucial information about a villain's evil plans
	- Example: Defending a stronghold in a fantasy RPG, the player might be assigned the mission to defend crucial stronghold from invading forces. This mission would showcase the player's role in the larger conflict

- Support the objective and provide a suitable environment for gameplay. It should guide the player towards the objective and create a sense of progression
- Exploration and Discovery: This would feature expansive and detailed environments with hidden secrets, points of interest and optional objectives
- You should present gameplay challenges or obstacles that the player needs to overcome
	- Example: Stealth Sequences - Gameplay challenges can require the player to remain undetected while infiltrating enemy territory or avoiding security systems. The mission might include guard patrols, security cameras, or sound-based mechanics that force the player to carefully plan their movements, use distractions and take advantages of the environment to stay hidden.

- The mission should have a well-paced flow, balancing moments of tension, exploration and action. It should engage the player's interest and maintain a sense of progression, avoiding excessive repetition or boredom!
-  Tension-Building Moments: The mission can include moments of suspense and tension. This could involve encounters with powerful enemies, exploring dark and atmospheric environments, or navigating through areas with limited resources or time constraints.
- Completing the mission should provide meaningful rewards to the player such as unlocking new abilities, story revelations or access to new areas. It may also have consequences or impact the game's narrative or world state.

	- Access to new areas: Finishing the mission can grant the player access to new areas or locations within the game world. This can open up opportunities for further exploration, side quests, or additional content that expands the player's experience and provides a sense of discovery
	- Unlocking new abilities: Completing the main line mission can reward the player with new abilities, skills or upgrades, that enhance their gameplay capabilities. These rewards can provide a sense of progression and empower the player to take on new challenges or explore previously inaccessible areas

# Balancing Spaces
- If players encounters the same type of gameplay over and over they may start feeling bored or disengaged
- Try to mix match gameplay elements to combat that! We can also offer optional or alternative approaches to cater to playstyles
- Be carefully sequencing these gameplay elements ensuring they complement each other, you can create a balanced experience
- Honestly, just try to give players variety and don't stress too much

Vary intensity and pacing of gameplay elements to maintain player interest. For example, mix moments of high-action combat with slower-paced exploration or puzzle solving sections

It's also essential to leverage the narrative and integrate gameplay elements seamlessly, enhancing the overall cohesion of the mission or quest.

- By alternating between stealth and action sequences, the level designer keeps the gameplay engaging while aligning with the narrative of covert operation
- It requires a deep understanding of the game's mechanics, the narrative and the player's experience

The goal is to balance gameplay elements in your mission and quests

Create captivating experiences that captivate players and keep then in the game world and its narrative

By examining how these game mix and match elements, we can gain insights into effective design strategies and learn from their success

Create captivating experiences that captivate players and keep them invested in the game world and its narrative

# Dialog
- As level designers, we often start by adding placeholder dialog to our missions to establish the overall narrative and give a sense of what's happening
- When designing levels, we need to create spaces that accommodate dialog and allow players to have meaningful conversations or experience narrative moments.
- The spaces should provide enough room for characters to interact and allow players to comfortably hear the dialog without feeling rushed or interrupted by gameplay elements
- Be carefully crafting the environment, we enhance the impact and immersion of the dialog for players
	- Through carefully crafted set pieces, environmental cues and atmospheric details, they enhance the dialog and deepen the player's connection to the game's world and characters
- Dialog is a collaborative process, and a dedicated story writer may later refine and enhance the lines to ensure they align with the game's overall narrative vision
	- Try your best to see if you can sneak some lines into the game. Many times writers will keep ones they like!
	- Collaboration between level designers and writers is crucial when integrating dialog into missions. As we design our levels, we should be open to feedback and interaction from the writing team
		- Story Departments can help us design better mission by understanding their structure


# Cutscenes and Cameras
- Level designers often utilize placeholder cutscenes and cameras during the design process to establish the desired narrative and cinematic moments within their levels
- These placeholders act as temporary representations of the final cutscenes and camera angles, helping the designers visualize the intended flow and pacing of the gameplay experience
	- Cameras and cutscenes are great way to organize your gameplay beats
- Level designers can experiment with different camera positions and movements to create dynamic and engaging scenes
	- This allows them to establish the desired atmosphere, highlight important events or points of interest and guide the player's focus
- Using placeholder cutscenes and cameras enables level designers to iterate on their designs, gather feedback and make necessary adjustments
	- All before handing off the final implementation to the appropriate teams
- Its a task for the level designer to figure out the impact of the cutscenes on the gameplay and on the stage flow. So early cutscenes can and probably will be implemented by the level designer


# Enemies and Combat Planning
- Combat Elements:
	- Spawn Closets:
	- Layouts:
	- Waves:

Contextualize:
- Make sense where the enemies spawn

!Get Vertical

Combat Architypes:
It's important to add variety and surprises within these archetypes to keep the gameplay fresh and exciting for players
- They can be combined, modified or expanded upon to suit the specific gameplay mechanics, narrative and artistic vision of the game being designed

Templates or structures for designing engaging combat. Serve as starting points for designing combat scenarios and can be adapted and combined to create more complex and engaging encounters
- They provide a framework for level designers to structure the flow, pacing and challenges of combat sequences

Ambush Architype:
- Enemies surprising the player from attacking from hiding position
	- Tension
	- Quick Reaction
	- Sudden Threat

Defense Architype:
- Stop and defend a stop from waves of NPCs

High and Lo Advantage:
- Explore the terrain to give the upper hand to the player or the enemies
- Given a strategic advantage

Stealth Architype:
- Allowing the players to stealth to eliminate enemies

Boss Battle:
- Challenging and Skill checking if the player can use what they learn to defeat the boss
- Exploiting the bosses weakness

Escort:
- Protect and NPC traverse a dangerous area

Arena Battle:

Multi-Stage:
- The battle field change during the battle as the boss IA

# Tutorials
Tutorials in games are designed to introduce players to game's mechanics, controls and core concepts. They provide guidance and instructions to help players understand how to play the game and navigate its features effectively

Level designers should allocate dedicated areas where players can learn and practice new mechanics or concepts without distractions
- These spaces should be designed in a way that allows players to experiment and understand the mechanics at their own pace

Placeholder tutorials can be used during the level design process to test and iterate on the tutorial sequences. These temporary tutorials provide a rough representation of the intended tutorial experience.
- By providing a separate tutorial space, players can focus on learning without the risk of failure or being overwhelmed by other gameplay elements

Integrate tutorial elements within the gameplay environment itself, such as using visual cues, environmental storytelling, or non-playable characters to guide and educate players.
- Place a glowing object near a locked door can indicate that the player needs to find a key to unlock it. The visual cue guides the player without explicitly stating what they need to do.

By embedding tutorials seamlessly into the level design players can learn while actively engaging with the game world, enhancing their immersion and understanding of the mechanics
- Use the environment itself to provide subtle tutorials. For a first person shooter, the first level might include a shooting range where the players can practice their aim and learn to controls before facing real enemies.

Designers can use the environment to provide subtle hints and clues. For instance, if players encounter a room with scattered papers and broken window, it suggests that there was a struggle or escape
- This environmental storytelling can imply that the players should investigate further or be cautious in that area


NPCs can be utilized to provide in-game guidance and tutorials. For example, an NPC companion can offer advice on combat techniques or explain the use of special abilities
- By integrating helpful NPCs into the game world, players can learn important gameplay mechanics while interacting with the characters

Level designers can introduce tutorials elements as part of gameplay itself. For instance, early levels of a platformer game might include simple jump sequences or obstacle courses to familiarize players with controls and mechanics
- This way, players learn by doing, gradually mastering gameplay as they progress

# Valves and Air locks

## Valves:
A design technique that restricts player movement or progress in a certain direction, typically to create a linear narrative experience
- Valves help level designers shape the player's journey, maintain narrative coherence, guide gameplay progression, and enhance the overall game experience by providing structure, direction and moments of tension and reward.

Really just points of no return or areas where the player's ability to backtrack or go back to previous sections of the level is intentionally blocked or limited
- By blocking off previous areas, level designers an ensure that players move forward and experience the game's story in the intended order

This techniques is often used to control the pacing and narrative flow of the game. You can also separate gameplay like dropping them into a combat scenario.
- Valves help prevent players to becoming lost or overwhelmed by providing a structured and directed gameplay experience

Valves can be used to mark significant milestones or checkpoints in the game. Crossing a valve often signifies progress and serves as a reward for the player's accomplishments

The player may encounter locked doors or barriers that can only be opened by activating valves located elsewhere in the level. Opening these valves grants access to new paths, secrets or rewards

Valves can be incorporated into time-based challenges, where the player needs to reach a specific location before the valve closes. This creates a sense of urgency and tests the player's speed and agility.

## Air Locks
Transitional spaces or areas where the game loads the next section while the player is still able to play, effectively hiding the loading process

This helps create a seamless transition between different areas or levels without interrupting the player's experience with visible loading screens or significant pauses

- This allows them to establish the desired atmosphere, highlight important events or points of interest and guide the player's focus

Air locks are commonly used to maintain immersion and flow within the game, allowing players to smoothly transition between gameplay segments or environments
- Cameras and cutscenes are great way to also organize your gameplay beats

Transitioning to new areas: when the player moves from one major area or zone to another, such as entering a new city district, a different biome or a different floor of a building, an airlock can be used to mask the loading screen or loading time

!!! The original God Of War did that a lot

Multiplayer Environments: In multiplayer games, airlocks can be used to synchronize and load new players into a shared game session without interrupting the experience for existing players.
- This ensures that everyone enters the game world at the same time and in a coordinated manner

Cinematics also can be used to hide the loading and transition between open/closed environments
