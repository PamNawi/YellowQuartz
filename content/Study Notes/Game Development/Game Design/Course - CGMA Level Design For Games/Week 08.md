# Bring Your Level to Life

Add small details to your blockouts to help immersion

- Get Things Moving!
	- Find ways to bring motion to the scene. When you're in the early stages of design try to imagine what kind elements could be moving. You cold try cloth blowing around, spinning windmills or AC vents, smaller items like pinwheels, or animating hanging items or even just simple plants, flying birds and other niara systems are great for bringing that element to make the world believable.
	- Dust and firefly particles. Put the damn fire on the map.
- Imagine Statements:
	- Simple screen title cards, that describe a cinematic or qte in the game to help fill the gaps when we don't have these available.
	- An excellent way to establish the pacing and narrative flow of the level. It helps you plan out key moments of your level. Better than trying to explain it in words while playing through the level
	- It helps you plan out key moments, understand the timing, and ensure a smooth transition between gameplay and storytelling elements
	- This technique allows you to fine-tune the player's experience and create a memorable and impactful moments within your level design
- Skydome and BG:
	- The background, sky and lighting play crucial roles in the setting the mood and atmosphere of your level. Think of some of your previous assignments and how some of those background elements made a difference
	- Whether it's a vibrant sunset, a dark and foreboding sky, or dynamic lighting changes, these visual aspects greatly enhance the player's experience and add depth to your level design
	- If visiting a different planet, we need to have hints so the players feels like they aren't somewhere familiar
- Lighthing and Post Processing:
	- By prototyping different lighting setups, you can explore various lighting styles, color palettes, and intensities to create the desired emotional impact
- UI Design:
	- While these UI elements in blockouts are temporary and serve as prototypes, they can be invaluable for testing and validating the level design concepts. They allow Level Designers to evaluate the usability, functionality, and overall player experience before the final UI is implemented
	- For example, a tooltip or on-screen prompt can appear when the player hovers over an interactive object, providing information or instructions
	- UI elements like minimaps, compassess, or directional indicators can assist players in navigating the level. By incorporating these elements into the blockout, Level Designers can test the effectiveness of the navigation system and ensure that players can easily orient themselves within the level.
	- It can help unify the visual elements of your level and create a cohesive look. By applying consistent color grading or tone mapping across different areas, you can ensure a seamless transition between various parts of your level and maintain visual continuity
- SFX / VFX:
	- VFX can be used to add atmospheric elements and environmental effects to the level. This includes effects like weather conditions, particle effects and dynamic lighting effects
	- These effects can bring the world to life and make it feel more realistic and immersive. For example impact effects can show the result of a player's attack or collision of objects while indicators and highlights can draw attention to important objects or areas
- Fake it Till you Make it
	- Whether it's a vibrant sunset, a dark and foreboding sky, or dynamic lighting changes, these visual aspects greatly enhance the player's experience and add depth to your level design

# Movement and Motion
- You can use the animations already made to enhance the environment and give some movement on the scene
- Use cloth with wind and other effects to give more movement to the scene

# Imagine Statement
Descriptive text blocks in-game or in video playthrough can be helpful technique for Level Designers to convey their intended vision and pacing for cutscenes, QTEs, cinematics, tutorials or other significant moments within the level.
- They serve as a starting point for visualizing and prototyping the level, helping to communicate the desired atmosphere and pacing to the development team and stakeholders
- When utilizing imagine statements, it's important to keep them concise clear, and focused on the essential details. They should convey the necessary information without overwhelming the player or cluttering the gameplay experience

- Convey Intended Experience
	- Imagine statements provide clear and concise description of the desired experience during specific gameplay moments
	- Additionally combining them with visual representations, such as concept art or story boards, can enhance their effectiveness and provide a more holistic understanding of the intended sequence
	- This helps ensure that the intended experience is effectively communicated and understood by the team and the important leads/directors
	- Imagine Statement Example: "As the player enters a dimly lit chamber, torchlight flickers, reveling ancient hieroglyphics carved into the walls. A crumbling stone slab slowly slides open, revealing a hidden passage"
- Establishing Pacing and Timing
	- Descriptive text blocks can assist in establishing the pacing and timing of key events within the level. It's hard to feel out the pace without seeing things take up time in game visually
	- By specifying the duration of cutscenes, the timing of button prompts in QTEs, or the Flow of dialogue in cinematics, level designers can fine-tune the rhythm of the gameplay experience.
	- Imagine Statement Example: "Upon entering a grand hall, the player spots a large-scale puzzle featuring two massive weighted scales. As the player interact with the levers, the camera zooms in on the intricate mechanism, showing the scales tipping and unlocking a secret door"
- Collaboration and Communication
	- Imagine Statements serve as a form of documentation that can be easily shared with the development team and used for collaborative discussions
	- Designers can use them to communicate their ideas and receive feedback from team members, including animators, scriptwriters or directors.
	- It helps ensure everyone involved in the development process has a clear understanding of the desired sequence and can contribute then expertise to refine and improve
	- Imagine Statement Example: "In a chase sequence, the player is pursued by a guardian, an undead pharaoh. As the player races through narrow corridors and dodges deadly traps, the camera dynamically follows their movements, capturing close calls and highlighting the environment"
- Iterative Design and Prototyping
	- Using Imagine Statements always level designers to iterate on their ideas more efficiently. We sometimes don't know what we want until we saw what we dislike.
	- By incorporating text descriptions early on, designers can create rapid prototypes or mock-ups of the intended sequences to test and evaluate their effectiveness
	- This iterative process helps identify potential issues, pacing inconsistencies, or opportunities for improvement before investing significant resources into full implementation
