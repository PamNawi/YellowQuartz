# Player Experience:
1. Responsive Controls
	- Get involved with testing and giving feedback
	- Tight and intuitive controls
	- Help other teams by providing gyms and testing
	- Don't forget how important you are to this process
2. Audio and Visual Feedback
	- Enhance platforming experience
	- SFX, VFX, Animations, etc on successful jumps, collectibles or hazards. Reward them for the good
3.  Checkpoints and Saving
	- A must for any large area that may have player failure
	- Alleviate frustration
	- Helps rapid playtesting
	- Encourage repeatability

# Leading the Player:
- Clearly defined paths and easy to navigate spaces
- Don't show all the stage at once!
- Give enough room for the players start the platform section and move around
- Guide the players using color

# Reusable Mechanics
Reusable game mechanics refer to gameplay elements or systems that can be used multiple times throughout a level or even across different levels. These mechanics are designed to be versatile, adaptable and easily added into various sections of the game

By reusing mechanics, level designers can promote consistency, enhance player familiarity and streamline the development process, while still offering a diverse and engaging gameplay experience.

Don't be fooled! When thinking design tests many people over-scope their ideas adding many new mechanics for players to get introduced to!

Instead... Focus on one or two main features of your level and concentrate on presenting simple and easy to understand game mechanics that fit the game.

Examples of things we re-use:
- Different size platforms
- Switch buttons
- Interactable
- Traversal mechanics
- Moving platforms / elevators
- Hazards

Consistency: Using same mechanics throughout the game enhances the player understanding

Efficiency: Reusing existing mechanics saves development time and resources

Depth: Reusable mechanics can be combined, layered or even modified to create more complex and engaging gameplay experiences

Mastery: Repeated exposure to mechanics, allows players to learn and improve their skills, providing a sense of progression

Check your difficult curve, pacing and progression of gameplay when implementing reusable mechanics

You need balance and variety, making sure that the mechanics are used in a way that keeps the gameplay fresh and interesting

# Spatial Awareness
How comfortable is to move around the space?
How much room the player has?

- Pay attention to the scale of your level. Be sure that objects, platforms and structures are appropriately sized relative to the player character, creating a sense of realist and allowing players to gauge distances accurately
- Design clear and distinct pathways that guide players through the level. Avoid cluttering the environment with unnecessary collision or distractions that may jack up player movement or disrupt the flor of gameplay
- Provide space for the players to land after performing jumps or other platforming actions. Avoid placing hazards or others obstructions immediately after landing points to prevent frustrating or unfair situations

# Affordances
A visual or contextual clue in a game that suggests how objects/elements can be used or interacted with. It's like a visual hint that tells the player what they can do and how they can navigate the game world.

"Monkey see, monkey do"

Keep consistency and make them easy to spot and understand just by observing. By applying visual language effectively you can make affordances more apparent and intuitive, guiding the player's understanding of how to interact with the environment

Affordances should provide feedback to the player when they interact with them. This can be through VFX, SFX or haptic feedback indicating that the interaction was successful and telling the player the result

# Limiting Confusion
Use environmental storytelling to convey information about the world, its history, and its NPC's. Arrange objects, props and details in a way that suggests a narrative or provides clues about the gameplay

Signposting
Design the layout and structure of your blockout in a way that naturally guides the player's attention and movement. Ensure that the path forward is visually distinct and easily discernible

Well-designed transition spaces ensure a cohesive and immersive experience for players, preventing jarring transitions and enhancing the overall flow of the level

# Don't tell me, show me
