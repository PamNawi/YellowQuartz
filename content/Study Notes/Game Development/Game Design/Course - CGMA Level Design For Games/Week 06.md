# Pathing and Transition Spaces
Encourage player exploration by providing multiple paths and routes for players to choose from

You can also design the level to support discovering hidden areas, rewards or secrets

Use visual cues, landmarks, or environmental elements to guide players and help them navigate through the open space

Use level blockout, lighting or color contrast to draw attention to important areas or points of interest

Find a balance between linear progression and non-linear exploration to cater to different player preferences

Provide a main critical path for players who prefer a more direct experience, while also offering optional side paths for those who enjoy exploration

Create diverse and interesting paths to avoid boredom and keep things fresh

Use different types of paths, such narrow alleys, wide open spaces, verticality, or hidden shortcuts, to add variety and promote exploration

Litter the paths with environmental storytelling elements that provide backstory, or hints about the world and its NPC's

Transition spaces connect different areas or level spaces, providing a smooth flow between them.
Ensure a seamless transition by maintaining consistency in visual style, lighting, sound design between connected spaces

Use visual cues, landmarks, or architectural elements that bridge the gap between areas to help player orientation and understanding

Maintain your theme by incorporating design elements or motifs that carry over from one space to another

Whenever you feel like you've entered or exited an area, think about what show players that

# Sightlines
Lines of sight within a level that allow players to see and perceive different elements of the environment

Help players understand their position and navigate through the level

Combine sightlines with composition by adding:
- Rule of thirds
- Golden Ratio
- Balance
- Position and negative space
- Flow
- Proportions
- Scale

You can use guiding lights on dark environments
