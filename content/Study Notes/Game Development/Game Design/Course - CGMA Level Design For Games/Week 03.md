# Player Goals
- Set Clear objectives for the player
- Feedback
- Give players a sense of progression

# Communication and Feedback
- Colors
- Lighting
- Cameras
- Audio Cues and Music
- Objectives
- Obstacles
!! Be Consistent !!
- Happens right away
- Be informative
- Do they know if they are right or wrong?

! When you give feedback matters
Playtesting is so important!!!
Take notes during the playtests
Play each other's levels

- Clarity
- Consistency
- Timing
- Balance
- Variety
- Purpose

# Visual Language in Design
- Much faster without interrupting the gameplay
- Colors
- Symbols
- Icons
- Patterns
- Textures
- Lighting
- Architecture
! Will look ugly and that's ok

# Shape language in Architecture
- Different shapes in your level inherently bring out responses or emotions from players
- Rectangles : Stability
- Circles : Unity
- Triangles: Action or Tension
- Curves: Helps break up overly squared levels
- Diagonals: Great way to use more of the space
	- Break up the line of sights

Natural and organic shapes:
	- Comforting and approachable shapes
	- Add some realism to movements
	- Not just rocks an terrain, can be man made

Abstract Shapes:
	- Keep recognizable
	- Simplified versions of organic shapes
	- Works best for POI or blending elements

!! Use hubs for central locations that connect out to other areas
!! Your repeatable shapes creates patterns and visual languages
!! Add the most iconic shapes for your level in your reference
!! Don't get too clever. Spade is a spade
!! Go bold and big shapes used as landmarks or POI
!! The more details uniqueness lets other know it's importance


# Composition

Basically how you are arranging the elements in your scene. Really just visually organizing your level

- Help navigation
- Better flow through the map
- Balance positive and negative space
- The intentional arrengement of physical objects, structures and spaces within a game environment. It involves placing elements as such as terrain, objects, buildings and enemies in a way that creates a cohesive and engaging gameplay experience.
- We can't control the camera, so we can build an entire area with a good spatial awaraness that suit players
- Separate your spaces, then think about entering and leaving each space !!! He made this a feedback for me during week 1 assignment !!!

- Rule of thirds
- Golden Ratio
- Golden Triangle
- Centered Composition
- Tonal Contrast
- Symmetrical Composition
- Color contrast
- Frame within the frame
- Triangle composition
- Dynamic Symmetry

# Occlusion in levels
Refers to a technique of blocking off or obscuring certain parts of the player's view in or to create a more interesting and believable environments. This can include the clues of physical objects such as walls or buildings, as well as visual effects such as fog or mist. The goal of occlusion is to create a sense of depth and realism in the game world, as well as to guide the player's attention towards specific areas or objectives

- Block line of sight with buildings, walls, objects
- Manage where the player is able to focus
- Don't overwhelm them with too many things
- Strategically reveal elements to create complexity

Geometry Obstruction
Terrain
Architecture
Lighting
SFX / VFX
Challenge players
Add complexity
Draw their attention
Add visual interest
Guide players intentionally

# Rewarding Curiosity
The use of environmental elements, such as the level design, objects and scenery to convey a narrative or backstory to the player without explicitly telling them through dialogue or cutscenes

- Use the space around you
- No cutscene (cutscenes are very expensive!)
- Design a world worth of exploring
- Consistent languages
- "Leave some breadcrumbs for the player to discover"
