Because the players starts with roughly the same set of circumstances on strategy games, many map designers use symmetry to easily achieve balance. However this create a very dull and predictable maps.

Designers can mitigate these effects by using different textures and props to vary the visual design of the map. A barrier can be created by a mountain or even a fallen rubble.

The diagram made by Tobias Heussner exemplify this:
- Blue circles -> Spawn Points
- Yellow Circles -> Sources of Resources
- Lines -> the easiest path

From this diagram the players start with roughly equal access to resources, an equal number of viable paths out of their base towards the no-manâ€™s land at the center of the map. This map is roughly symmetrical.
