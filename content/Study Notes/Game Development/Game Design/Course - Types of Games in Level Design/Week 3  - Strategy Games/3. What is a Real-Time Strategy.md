Real-time strategy games, often called RTS games, take the concept of 4X strategy games, and remove the turn-based gameplay. Instead, players are acting simultaneously, in real time. Features such as units, buildings, upgrades, tech trees, and resource management all still apply—only now the player must contend with the possibility that their enemy might be advancing more quickly than them

A example of RTS game is Warcraft 3

# Pacing
Units and buildings must be constructed at a pace conducive to exciting play, so they are fast enough that the player isn't waiting, but slow enough that failing to act at a key moment can doom the player. The pacing can be influenced by level design since it defines the geography of the map influence on how the players can expand their territory, how the economy can grow or when they will encounter opponents on it.

# Balance
Giving every player a fair chance at victory requires careful balance. When designing different factions, designers must make sure no one faction, or unit in a faction, has an overpowering advantage. Knowing which units in one faction’s army can counter another faction’s units is an important part of RTS strategy. Likewise, maps must be designed so that no player starts with a clear advantage—everyone should have roughly equal access to resources and advantageous terrain.

# Complexity
One of the big challenges in designing an RTS is to try and preserve as much of the tactical depth and complexity from their turn-based counterparts, while keeping the game simple and streamlined enough that players can make quick decisions under pressure.

# Micro versus Macro
Related to the issue of complexity is the issue of “micro-management,” in which players must command the actions of individual units on a small scale (which units to attack; when and how to retreat or maneuver) versus “macro-management,” in which players must consider the overall state of their economy, where and how to expand their territory, and so on. Well-designed RTS games allow for opportunities for both micro and macro skills to be put to good use.
