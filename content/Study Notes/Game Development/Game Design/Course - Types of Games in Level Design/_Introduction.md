My review on this is this chapter for me was so shallow that was hard to even take notes... so I didn't take it... There's two videos recommendations made during this module that I'm placing the link bellow to watch when is necessary

# Final Review:
⭐⭐⭐

If you don't like certain genre of game on the list and you need to start somewhere to learn, this is an good start. It was so hard to read some chapters inside that I took a long pause, made another curse [The psychology of color in game design and development](obsidian://open?vault=content&file=Study%20Notes%2FArt%20%26%20Design%2FColor%2FCourse%20-%20The%20Psychology%20of%20Color%20in%20Game%20Design%20and%20Development%2F_Introduction) so I had mental break and created energy again.
