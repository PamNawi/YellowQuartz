# Experience
🍓 **Strawberry Fields — Game Developer < Remote > (2022 - 2024)**
In the late months as an employee she made some maps for [[_Aexia|Aexia]]. During this months she fall in love with level design. Originally she collaborated with a small team to architect, develop and deploy high-quality applications as indicated by the company. She helped to manage and mentor a group of software engineers, while writing a clean, high-quality, high-performance, maintainable code.

💻 **Luminos — Programming Consultancy < Remote > (2020 - 2022)**
Luminos uses agile methods of development, with weekly remote meetings with the dev team and the client to update how the projects are progressing and to get quick feedback from the client.

- *BG Project (July 2020 - February 2022):*   She acted as a consultant for the BG project, reviving it from scratch in Unity after the original team had faced optimization issues. Her efforts included integrating the project with tractor hardware, utilizing a shader to visualize the tractor's path and product distribution based on real-time GPS data captured by an Android application.
- *Neuro Project (August 2021 - February 2022):*  She served as a consultant for the Neuro project, which utilized VR technology to train medical students. Her responsibilities included creating interfaces for the diagnosis stage and revising all pins used in the interface for the anamnesis and physical exam phases based on client feedback. This involved verifying technical names, pin content, case commentary, screen position, and order for each of the 160 pins. Additionally, she revised, adapted, and debugged the code for each stage, paying close attention to medical details. The project encompassed over 80 cases, with a focus on ensuring Unity interface ease of population by the team.

👩‍🏫 **Universidade Positivo — Teacher < Presencial > (2017 - 2020)**
She taught the Digital Games course at Universidade Positivo in the subjects of Computer Graphics, [[_Classroom notes for Game Development on AI|Artificial Intelligence]], and Physics for the Game Developer course.

During the early years, the course was bimestrial and she taught each subject in a stream way, first computer graphics, followed by physics, and then AI. During the last bimester, she was doing some classes to prepare her for the doctorate. These classes were focused on advanced statistics, advanced data structure, and machine learning. During every class, the students needed to create a game with a theme and the knowledge learned during the classes and the teachers had to advise every team. It was an internal mini-game jam.

The course in 2019 was converted from bimestrial to semestral and she keeps teaching the same subjects. This year she also was an advisor to a team of students on the course conclusion work.

During each year she created material for each class and had an impeccable time plan schedule.  Have organized some events in the area, being the major one the [Glitch-Mundo](https://github.com/GlitchMundo/glitch-tyba). The last Glitch-Mundo was a free 10 day collaboration event that was made between the Universidade Positivo, Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná and GamEscola. The last Glitch-Mundo had more than 500 participants.

# Hobbies
- 🎮 **Gaming:** She plays a lot of MMORPGs, but mainly Ragnarok Mobile: Eternal Love, where she's the leader of a 4fun guild. Which she does every week with a variety of players. Exceeds as Divine Avenger (a paladin 4th job) which she does the majority of the PvE instances and Luna Danseuse (a dancer 4th job) for the PvP instances. In both classes, she tries to be more supportive and tank for the team, than the main DPS. You can check her guild's digital garden [here](https://s2-kawaii-vault.vercel.app)

- 🧶 **Knitting & Crochet:** Has self-taught both of the crafts and has more than 10 years of experience in knitting and 5+ years of crochet. The major difficulty was the fact she is a left-handed person, and in the early period, she didn’t know English so it was very challenging. During these years both crafts have trained her to see recurring patterns and write them for her future self and other people

- 📓 **Bullet Journaling:** She keeps more than 7 years of minimalist physical bullet journaling daily. That way she’s good at documenting what she is doing each day of the week and planning for long-term projects. Also she’s good at planning her routine to accommodate every task

- 🎸 **Playing Bass:** She’s learning to play the bass which was always a dream of hers. During this journey, she’s also studying music theory and learning some of the area jargon
