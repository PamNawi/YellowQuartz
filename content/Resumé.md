Knows the following programming languages ​​with projects developed in the following languages: Python, C++, and C#. Also mastered programming using Unity. The known and used libraries were mainly focused on academic use, such as creating graphics, creating prototypes for physical simulations, or even parallel processing.

Developed some smaller side projects also using the following languages: LISP, LUA, and Ruby.

# Experience

## Strawberry Fields — Senior Programmer < Remote >

She collaborates with a small team to architect, develop and deploy high-quality applications as indicated by the company. She’s helping to manage and mentor a group of software engineers, while writing a clean, high-quality, high-performance, maintainable code.

## Luminos — Programming Consultancy < Remote >

Luminos uses agile methods of development, with weekly remote meetings with the dev team and the client to update how the projects are progressing and to get quick feedback from the client.

### BG Project (July 2020 - February 2022):

She is acting as a consultant for the BG project and is focusing on loading maps with the .shp format in Unity for an Android application that runs on a tractor. Originally the project was being developed by another team and had trouble with optimization and was abandoned because of that. When she entered to consult on this project on Luminos she reconstructed this project on Unity from zero. Today this project is being integrated with the tractor hardware.

For this project, a shader was created to paint where the tractor has passed and how much product is placed on the land using information that comes from the Android application that captures the GPS tractor info. The necessary textures are generated in real-time but can be stored and loaded from the hardware.

### Neuro Project (August 2021 - February 2022):

Also, she is acting as a consultant for the Neuro project in parallel, which uses VR technology to train medical students. Her job is to create interfaces for the diagnosis stage and, with the client feedback update, and revise all the pins used on the interface anamnesis and physical exam phase. This revision consists of verifying the name of the pin (normally a technical name), the content of the pin, the commentary about the case, position on the screen and the order of each pin. For the anamnesis and physical exam phase there’s 160 pins. 

For each stage the code was revised, adapted and bugs were corrected. The job requires a lot of attention because of the details from the medical aspects (technical names, order of each field/pin, …). There’s a total of 80+ cases.

Another aspect there was a focus is to ensure that the interface within Unity was easily populated by the team.

## Universidade Positivo — Teacher < Presencial > (2017 - 2020)

She taught the Digital Games course at Universidade Positivo in the subjects of Computer Graphics, Artificial Intelligence, and Physics for the Game Developer course.

During the early years, the course was bimestrial and she taught each subject in a stream way, first computer graphics, followed by physics, and then AI. During the last bimester, she was doing some classes to prepare her for the doctorate. These classes were focused on advanced statistics, advanced data structure, and machine learning. During every class, the students needed to create a game with a theme and the knowledge learned during the classes and the teachers had to advise every team. It was an internal mini-game jam.

The course in 2019 was converted from bimestrial to semestral and she keeps teaching the same subjects. This year she also was an advisor to a team of students on the course conclusion work.

During each year she created material for each class and had an impeccable time plan schedule. Have organised some events in the area, being the major one the 

[Glitch-Mundo](https://github.com/GlitchMundo/glitch-tyba). The last Glitch-Mundo was a free 10 day collaboration event that was made between the Universidade Positivo, Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná and GamEscola. The last Glitch-Mundo had more than 500 participants.

## Itch.io — [ Participant ] : [https://pamnawi.itch.io](https://pamnawi.itch.io)

During the specialisation everytime she had to make a new game for some class, she took the opportunity to make a game jam at itch.io.

# Hobbies

## Gaming
She plays a lot of MMORPGs, but mainly Ragnarok Mobile: Eternal Love, where she's a vice leader of a guild. Which she does every week with a variety of players. Exceeds as Divine Avenger (a paladin 4th job) which she does the majority of the PvE instances and Luna Danseuse (a dancer 4th job) for the PvP instances. In both classes, she tries to be more supportive and tank for the team, than the main DPS

## Knitting & Crochet 
Has self-taught both of the crafts and has more than 10 years of experience in knitting and 5+ years of crochet. The major difficulty was the fact she is a left-handed person, and in the early period, she didn’t know English so it was very challenging. During these years both crafts have trained her to see recurring patterns and write them for her future self and other people

## Bullet Journaling 
She keeps more than 7 years of minimalist physical bullet journaling daily. That way she’s good at documenting what she is doing each day of the week and planning for long-term projects. Also she’s good at planning her routine to accommodate every task

## Playing Bass 
She’s learning to play the bass which was always a dream of hers. During this journey, she’s also studying music theory and learning some of the area jargon
