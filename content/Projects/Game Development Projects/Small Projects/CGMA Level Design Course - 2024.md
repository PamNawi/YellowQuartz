This project is a level design study developed during the final two weeks of the CGMA Level Design 2024 course, using Unreal Engine 5.3. Combining jungle and sci-fi themes suggested by the instructor, the focus was on creating visual compositions that guide the player, as there was no combat system implemented. Additionally, I aimed to incorporate subtle storytelling elements throughout the environment to enhance the immersive experience.
