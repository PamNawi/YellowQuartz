The premade SETs and maps are a group of content made to allow the GMs to have a quick setup for their games. The SETs and Maps should be generic enough to allow for the GMs use and adapt, be "tileable" with small adjustments, but also sustain the roleplay for players to act.

For the maps the plan was to build maps to teach how the SETs could be combined by the GMs, with enough content to also split it into the premade SETS:

- [[Radiant Citadel]]
- [[Ebon Rest Sanctuary]]
- [[The Enchanted Forest SETs]]
- [[Modern House and Cafe]]
