Its a small project that I started to build for Blocktober 2024. I wanna a small game just so I could train and learn more on Level Design. I pick to revive an old idea: The Lost Vikings, but with goblins. The idea here was to explore how to build an environment for multiple characters traverse.

I choose Unity as the Game Engine here so I could move fast on the project and just focus on the level design.
Since my focus was on level design, I'm using a bunch of free CC0 assets from internet:
- Tileset : [Generic Dungeon Pack](https://bakudas.itch.io/generic-dungeon-pack) by [Anokolisa](https://anokolisa.itch.io)
- Characters : [Pixel Art RPG Character Creator](https://edermunizz.itch.io/pixel-art-rpg-character-creator) by [Edermunizz](https://edermunizz.itch.io)
- Health Bar: [Hearts n Bars](https://bdragon1727.itch.io/basic-pixel-health-bar-and-scroll-bar) by [BDragon1727](https://bdragon1727.itch.io)
- VFX : [Super Package Retro Pixel Effects 32x32 pack 2](https://bdragon1727.itch.io/super-package-retro-pixel-effects-32x32-pack-2) by [BDragon1727](https://bdragon1727.itch.io)
- Other GUI: [Edinnu UI Starter Pack](https://rowdy41.itch.io/edinnu-ui) by [rowdy41](https://rowdy41.itch.io)

I also took the opportunity for participate another two game jams:
