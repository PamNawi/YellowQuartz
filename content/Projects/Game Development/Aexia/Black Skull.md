A pirate ship transformed into a mysterious crime scene for detectives daring enough to uncover a murder. This map is made of 18 SETs, which are small cubic spaces with 5 meters, where players with their own personal objectives also should investigate a crime scene.

The map follows the shape of a ship and there's both interior and external areas for the players to explore and was used photos from real pirate ships and other games. The windows inside the ship and the railing from the main deck are positioned in a way that guarantee that the players would never see inside other areas from the game and would have the immersion and illusion broken.

## The Main Deck
The main deck is the heart of the ship,  is compose by 6 SETs in a 2x3 grid in the middle of the map. Its a rich environment with various props for players act with and is the main hub for all the other SETs. From here the players can quick move between SETs to explore the other areas. 

Its the only external area where the players can see the skybox and the ocean at the same time from the whole map and its built in a way that the walls blocks the view from players inside the main deck to the other areas of the ship.

## The Kitchen
The original zoom version game the players could go up to the crow's nest of the ship. Because technological limitations on Black Skull was chosen to have a kitchen inside the ship as substitute.  For this SET was used the kitchen from the [Dunbrody Famine Ship Experience](https://www.tripadvisor.com/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g186641-d1720902-i45522462-Dunbrody_Famine_Ship_Experience-New_Ross_County_Wexford.html) as reference. The exact photo reference used is the following:

The small environment with only 1 SET is full with knifes, plates, cups and bottles so the players can grab and use to create their own narratives. The windows was positioned in a way that the players could see any other SET from inside the ship. The results are the following:

## The Captain's Quarters
For the Captain's Quarters the refence used comes from other games, since on the original pirate ships the captain's slept with the rest of the crew on the majority of the pirate ships. This SET is also very small, but the intention was to give a luxurious environment with a lot of red, cloths, gold coins and even a treasure. The reference used comes from [Brenda Bae](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/e0awN3).

Since this environment is closed and very poor illuminated it was used a blue light to give the illusion of it. To keep the illusion of being inside a pirate ship, the windows where positioned in the opposite side of the kitchen, this way preventing that the player could observe any movement from other players inside it.

## The Crew Quarters
In contrast with the opulent captain's quarter, the crew's quarters are humble with bunk beds, smaller chests and a messy table with wine bottles. Its based on real life examples like the photo from [Constantine Gregory](https://fineartamerica.com/featured/plimoth-mayflower-sleeping-quarters-constantine-gregory.html) from the Plimoth Mayflower Sleeping Quarters:

## The Storage Room
The storage room is a grid of 2x1 SETs positioned in a straight line full of knick-knacks the pirates pilled during their adventures. This is the place where the quartermaster kept the finances would supervises the the supplies and provisions for the ship. This group of SETs use the environment created by [MystiqueX on Devianart](https://www.deviantart.com/mystiquex/art/Pirate-Ship-Screenshot-3-195596358) as reference:

## The others SETs on Black Skull
The other SETs where created by other member from the team and I just helped by doing some minor adjustments on the angles on objects and creating the necessary textures.
