"Ebon Rest Sanctuary" is a meticulously crafted map designed for Game Masters, featuring three distinct areas: The Graveyard, Church Exterior, and Church Interior. The Graveyard, constructed with 2x2 SETs, seamlessly transitions into the expansive Church Exterior, comprised of 3x4 SETs. A portal at the church entrance serves as the gateway to the intricately detailed Church Interior, built with 2x3 SETs.

Take note of the strategically placed message board in front of the church, providing a convenient platform for Game Masters to communicate with players. Additionally, the graveyard offers hidden nooks where GMs can discreetly place small objects or messages to enhance gameplay.
