The Radiant Citadel is a premade map created with the solo objective to have the SETs separated and made into premade SETs for the GMs with a medieval theme. It has 32 SETs with: medieval castle throne, a castle corridor, a closed garden] a small grove, an INN, a kitchen, an apothecary, two bedrooms and war room. The top down view of this map is the following. Each group of SETs will presented after it.

## Castle Throne Room
This big area is made by SETs placed in a 3x3 grid. Its the biggest group inside the Citadel.
This area was made to host a wedding, a feast, a coronation or even an accolade ceremony.  The references for this was ["The Accolade"] from Edmund Leighton and the Iron Throne from Game of Thrones:

To mix and match the main idea for this group is to keep the throne SET and switch the SETs with the tables both using an empty SET with matching walls or even the [Church and Graveyard] SETs with the long church chairs:

## Castle Corridor
This is a smaller group of made by 3x1 SETs placed in a line. Both SETs end are the same and but mirrored and in the middle there's a very simple SET with just one chandelier. The entrances on this was adapted, by removing the stone pillars and used used as entrance for the throne room on all variations.

## Castle Bedroom
This is a single SET with a fancy bedroom, but could be easily adapted to be used inside a mansion as a single SET by exchanging the walls.

## Castle Kitchen
This is a single SET with a kitchen, originally comes with the citadel, but could be easily adapted to be used inside a medieval house as a single SET.

## The Castle Garden and the Grove
A common place for conversations and strolls between characters on many books are the castle garden and the groove.


The groove is a 2x2 group of SETs combined was planned to be combined mixed and match with the [[The Enchanted Forest]] SETs.


## The Medieval Tavern
Its very common for TTRPGs campaigns start on at any sort of tavern. Here we have a tavern ready made with 2x2 to be used by the GMs start their games. The tables SETs can be used alone and replicate to easily expand the environment or even combined with the tables from the throne room feast SETs.

## INN Bed
Its common for the INN to have a place for the adventurers to sleep during the nights, thinking about this kind of situation this single SET was created:
